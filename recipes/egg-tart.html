        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The egg tart, or <i>dan tat</i> in Cantonese, is a beloved Chinese pastry with influences from the English custard tart and Portuguese <i>pastel de nata</i>. It is commonly served at dim sum restaurants and bakeries. This recipe for a Hong Kong style egg tart is a perfect combination of light, creamy custard and buttery, flaky crust.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Custard Filling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 eggs, beaten--reserve 2 tablespoons for your pastry dough</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup water, hot</li>
                    <li>6 tablespoons sugar</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup evaporated milk</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Pastry Dough</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups cake flour</li>
                    <li>115 grams unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons egg, beaten</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, sift flour, sugar, and salt. Add softened butter. Bring the mixture together with your hands.</li>
                    <li>Whisk the egg yolks, and add the 2 tablespoons of beaten yolk to the flour mixture. Bring together until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Melt sugar and salt with hot water. Mix until dissolved and let cool.</li>
                    <li>Add the rest of the beaten egg yolk. Stir in sugar water and evaporated milk. Combine well.</li>
                    <li>Strain the filling to ensure there are no lumps. Chill in the refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                    <li>Take the dough out and divide into 16 equal portions. Spray the tart pan with a light coating of oil. Take one portion of your dough and roll it into a ball and place in your tart shell. Press the shell into the pan with your fingers. Repeat to finish all.</li>
                    <li>Pour the custard filling into the shells until about 80% full. Bake for 15-20 minutes until the surface becomes golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Cool down for several minutes, and then remove the egg tarts from the pan.</li>
                </ol>
